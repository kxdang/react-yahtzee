## React Yahtzee

A React project from Colt Steele starter file from Udemy - [The Modern React Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/).
Starter file had incomplete game, I learned how to work with another users' code and fixed various bugs:

- State logic to run the game
- Dice rolling
- Score description addition
- I added flexbox to the table to fix app and made it mobile friendly!
